# javaBackup
Congratulations! You found it!
This is a backup of all of my Java labs for Mr. Hendricks's class.
Feel free to use what inspiration you need.
(or just rip the program directly. I don't care, but you'll probably get caught for plagiarism)
Good luck! I'm sorry about my naming convention.
